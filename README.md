# TomatoApp

The aim of the project is to create Zomato kind of application using Angular.

According to city or location (latitude and longitude) you should show the restaurants in card list format with image and brief details. There should be one search bar. Where user can search the restaurants with location. After clicking on particular restaurant detailed page should be open.
